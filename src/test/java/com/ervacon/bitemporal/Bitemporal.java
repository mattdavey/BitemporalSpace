 * A bitemporal object. A bitemporal object is essentially a value tracked in two time dimensions:
 * <ol>
 * 	<li>Validity time: indicates when the value was valid</li>
 * 	<li>Recording time: indicates when the value was known</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Tracking information bitemporally allows you to aswer questions along the lines of "On january second 1999, what
 * did we think the valid value was for september first 1980.".
 * <p>
 * In most cases, application level could should not directly implement this interface, but should instead
 * wrap existing value classes bitemporally using a {@link BitemporalWrapper}.
